#KEYWORDS_
#DESKTOP
Desktop mainly divided into three parts- 1. Computation 2.Storage 3. Network 
#COMPUTATION
A)CPU-central processing unit It is the primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing tasks.often to referred to as the "brain" of the computer.
B)GPU-graphic processing unit It is a specialized processor designed to handle and accelerate the rendering of images, video and animation.It can handle many operations simultaneously.
C)DPU-data processing unit
D)TPU-tensor processing unit
#STORAGE
1.primary storage: it is volatile. Primary memory provides very fast access to data,smaller capacity. e.g.RAM
2.secondary storage: it is Non-volatile ,Slower access,larger capacity: .e.g.hard disk,CD
#.NETWORK:-
1)Local Area Network (LAN):
A LAN covers a small geographic area, such as a home, office, or campus. It connects devices within this limited area.
2)Wide Area Network (WAN):
A WAN spans a large geographic area, like multiple cities, countries. WANs can be public, like the internet, or private, like intranet.
#OPERATING SYSTEM(OS):
An Operating system is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. it act as an intermediary between users and computer hardware
The most commonly used Operating System(OS):-
WINDOWS
MACos
LINUX
#NIC
An Operating system is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. it act as an intermediary between users and computer hardware
#CLOUD COMPUTING
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet ("the cloud"). This allows for faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
#BLOCKCHAIN:
Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger technology that securely records transactions across multiple computers in a way that prevents alteration or tampering. It operates as a chain of blocks, each containing a list of transactions. Once a block is added to the chain, it is difficult to change any information in that block without altering all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus from the network. This makes blockchain a transparent and secure method for managing and verifying transactions. It's commonly used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but also has applications in various other fields, such as supply chain management, voting systems, and smart contracts. Some famous examples are
1.ARM
2.CISC[complex instruction set computer]-
it is a closed source like intel and AMD(advanced micro devices).It develop X-86 series under ISA[intruction set arichtecture] in 1978.

3.RISC[reduced instruction set computer]-
it is a close source like ARM[Adavnce risc machine] .It has specific intruction,very fast and efficient.

4.RISC-V-
It is based on RISC principles and develop in 2023 and which is a free open source. it also have a project called SHAKTI.

5.ASIC:-
ASIC stands for Application-Specific integrated circuit. it's a type of integrated circuit designed for a specific application or function, rather than general puerpose use. for example, an ASIC designed for cryptocurrency mining is specifically built to perform the hashing calculations required for mining.
#BARE METAL
A bare-metal system is a computer system that operates directly on the hardware without the use of an operating system. This means that the software running on the system has direct access to the hardware resources, such as the CPU, memory, and Input/Output devices.
In simpler terms, it's like running a car without a driver: the engine and other components are working directly, without any intermediary system to manage them.
#DNS(Domain Name System)
DNS stands for Domain Name System. It functions like a phone book for the internet, translating human-friendly domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network.

#VPN(Virtual Private Network)
A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is a service that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. It allows you to access the internet as if you were connected to a private network, providing privacy and security.
When you use a VPN, your internet traffic is routed through a secure server before reaching its destination, adding a layer of privacy and security. However, it's important to choose a reputable VPN provider to ensure your data is handled securely and your privacy is protected.
FRONTEND,BACKEND AND API(Application Programming Interface)
In web development, the terms frontend, backend, and API refer to different aspects of building and managing applications. Here’s a breakdown of each:

1.Frontend
Frontend refers to the client-side of a web application. It encompasses everything that users interact with directly in their web browsers. This includes:

2.Backend
Backend refers to the server-side of a web application. It involves everything that happens on the server and is responsible for managing and processing data. Key aspects include:

3.API
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs can be used to connect Frontend and Backend

#Together, these components work to create a complete web application, with the frontend providing the user experience, the backend managing data and logic, and the API facilitating communication between the two.
#ETHERNET
Ethernet is a family of wired computer networking technologies commonly used in local area networks (LAN), metropolitan area networks (MAN) and wide area networks (WAN). It was commercially introduced in 1980 and first standardized in 1983 as IEEE 802.3
